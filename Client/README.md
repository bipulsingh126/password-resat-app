# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Client Folder Documentation

### Overview
The `Client` folder contains the front-end part of the application. It includes all the necessary files for building and running the client-side interface using React and Vite.

### Key Components

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the client-side application.

- **`src` Directory**: Contains the source code for the React components, styles, and other assets.

- **`public` Directory**: Holds static files such as images and fonts that are directly served by the server.

- **Configuration Files**: Includes configuration files like `eslint.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, and `vite.config.js` for setting up the development environment.

- **Package Files**: `package.json` and `package-lock.json` manage the project's dependencies and scripts.

### Development
To start the client-side development server, navigate to the `Client` directory and run the appropriate npm commands as specified in the `package.json`.
